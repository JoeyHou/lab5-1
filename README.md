Lab 5
====

This is the fifth lab for COGS120/CSE170-Interaction Design. It is about putting most of the things in previous labs together: the server (node.js), the usage of template, routes, and controller, and the basic web-dev technique like css and javascript. After this lab, I learnt how to make a interactive web consists of form.
